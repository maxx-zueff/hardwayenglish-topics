# HardwayEnglish

Every sweet Victory requires hard patience and experience. I can't see any easy way of learning english. You should repeat rules and work pretty hard out.

### What is HardwayEnglish?

**HardwayEnglish** is the collections of english grammar rules. The basic idea is typing and again typing sentences by english grammar rules. At the beginning of learning allowed only one collection with rules (Present Simple for example). To unlock more collections you should make an effort and be patient. You should work hard in order to learn what English is!

Every rule has few examples with construction of following rule. You should type this examples to pass next rule. The application counts an amount of mistakes while you are typing. If you have many mistakes the application doesn’t allow you to next rule.

When you complete each rule in topic you should pass the test by these rules. After completing test you'll be able to get new topic, if you don't make any mistakes. If you do, you should wait **8 HOURS** and then you'll get next **STAGE 2**. It’s same rules in same topic, but you must make very small amount of mistakes to pass. When you complete it, you need wait **8 HOURS** again for the next **STAGE 3**. That is last stage. There you must not make any mistakes! Well then, if you can complete it, new topic with new rules will be unlocked.

And after five days of passing topic, you need to pass the exam. At this point every opened topics gets locked and you must type examples from you old topic you pass five day ago without mistakes! After complete it, opened topics by you come back.

### Features of HardwayEnglish

- Over 100 English grammar rules are available for you already right now. We thought that it's not enough, so we are adding up even more rules and quizzes as well as improving current content.

- In order to improve your grammar, you need to re-type the given text with the applied grammar rules.

- You probably have been wandering why is it a "Hardway English" if the only thing that is needed is to re-type the sentences. Well, we are fond of the some computer games from 90s with their rather distinguishable feature of being unable to auto-save anytime you want. At certain point, you've started to know this game like a path - the path that requires knowledge and skills. So, yep, you got it - same as in old games - you will need to get it to the level of perfection - any single/minor mistake will get you all the way back - no matter how far have you gone.

- Our team is young, agile and ambitiously powerful driven by the idea of bringing English (even though it's hardway) to everyone! So, if you are an English professor, native speaker or just an advanced/proficient English speaker, then you are welcome to join our team!
