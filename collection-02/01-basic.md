# Basic

### Brief description

A **sentence** is a group of words that are put together to make one complete thought.

The basic parts of a sentence are the **subject** and the **verb**. The **subject** is usually a noun â€” a word that names a person, place, or thing. The **verb** \(or predicate\) usually follows the subject and identifies an action or a state of being.

### Pattern

`Subject` + `Verb` = `Complete Thought`

### Examples

> **I** **love** English

> **I** **am** American

> **The cake** **looks** delicious

> **My name** **is** Liza

> **The family** **lives** in a small house
